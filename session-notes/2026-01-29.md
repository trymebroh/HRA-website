# Session Notes - 2026-01-29

## Summary
Repository migration and cache configuration updates. Switched from old HRA-website repo to new High-Ridge-website repo on Jay's GitHub. Updated cache headers to match IHH project conventions.

---

## Completed

### Repository Migration
- Updated `jay` remote from `maddenco-gigem/HRA-website.git` to `maddenco-gigem/High-Ridge-website.git`
- Created new `drafts` branch on jay's new repo
- Pushed trigger commits to both `main` and `drafts` branches to test Netlify deploys

### Cache Header Updates
- Updated `netlify.toml` to match Intention-Holistic-Health-website caching conventions
- **Previous settings**: 1 year cache with `immutable` flag (assets never revalidate)
- **New settings**:
  - Images & fonts: 3 months (7,776,000 sec) with `must-revalidate`
  - CSS & JS: Always revalidate (`max-age=0, must-revalidate`)
  - HTML: Always revalidate (`max-age=0, must-revalidate`)

### Why These Changes
1. **Repository change**: Jay forked from trymebroh's repo which may not have been fully up to date with local files. New repo created for cleaner separation.
2. **Cache strategy**: Old `immutable` setting prevented browsers from ever checking for updates. New `must-revalidate` approach means:
   - Users still get fast loads from cache
   - CSS/JS/HTML changes deploy instantly (no stale content)
   - Images/fonts cached for 3 months but browsers check if modified

## Pending

- Verify Netlify deploys correctly from new repo
- Consider updating `origin` remote to match new naming convention (`High-Ridge-website`)
- Review if any content differences exist between repos (user reported hero text formatting and darkness differences on live site vs local)

## Notes

- Local files are source of truth
- The `drafts-websites-edits` branch still exists on jay's repo from the old setup
- New `drafts` branch created fresh from current `main`
