## Technical Notes

### Marquee Animation
```css
@keyframes marqueeScroll {
  0% { transform: translateX(0); }
  100% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
}

@keyframes marqueeScrollReverse {
  0% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
  100% { transform: translateX(0); }
}
```
- Items are duplicated in HTML for seamless loop
- Mask-image used for fade-out edges

### Button Specificity Fix
The `.btn-gold` wasn't displaying properly due to specificity conflicts with `.btn` base class. Fixed with:
```css
.btn.btn-gold {
  background: linear-gradient(...);
  background-color: var(--gold-500);
  /* ... */
}
```

### Card Hover Animation Override
Stagger animation was causing delayed hover. Fixed with `!important`:
```css
.card.card-value {
  transition: transform 100ms ease, box-shadow 100ms ease, border-color 100ms ease !important;
}
```

## Technical Notes

### Cookie Consent Implementation
```javascript
// Default consent denied
gtag('consent', 'default', {
  'analytics_storage': 'denied',
  'ad_storage': 'denied'
});

// Update on acceptance
gtag('consent', 'update', {
  'analytics_storage': 'granted'
});
```

### Netlify Event Functions
Named `submission-created.js` to automatically trigger on form submissions. Netlify recognizes this naming convention and invokes the function when forms are submitted.

### Image Format Decision
WebP at 95% quality was larger than original JPGs for most images because the original JPGs were already well-optimized. Only used WebP where it provided actual size reduction.

---
