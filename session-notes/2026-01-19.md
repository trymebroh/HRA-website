## Technical Notes

### Marquee Animation
```css
@keyframes marqueeScroll {
  0% { transform: translateX(0); }
  100% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
}

@keyframes marqueeScrollReverse {
  0% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
  100% { transform: translateX(0); }
}
```
- Items are duplicated in HTML for seamless loop
- Mask-image used for fade-out edges

### Button Specificity Fix
The `.btn-gold` wasn't displaying properly due to specificity conflicts with `.btn` base class. Fixed with:
```css
.btn.btn-gold {
  background: linear-gradient(...);
  background-color: var(--gold-500);
  /* ... */
}
```

### Card Hover Animation Override
Stagger animation was causing delayed hover. Fixed with `!important`:
```css
.card.card-value {
  transition: transform 100ms ease, box-shadow 100ms ease, border-color 100ms ease !important;
}
```
